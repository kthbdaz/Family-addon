<info>Having wiped out all the children in his home town, dreamstalking psychokiller Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) decides it is time to head for pastures new. Luckily for him, he happens across a home for troubled teens and is soon indulging his unspeakable appetites once again. This was originally intended to be the final instalment in the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' series, but director Wes Craven was unable to resist bringing Freddy back one more time in his 1994 'Wes Craven's New Nightmare'.</info>

<info>A coda to the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' series that, written and directed by the creator Wes Craven, mixes fact and fiction to scare us witless. Craven and his producer play themselves, persuading the now grown up Heather Langenkamp (of the first film) to return to Elm Street one more time. She and Robert Englund are lured back to play their characters again, but this time they cannot walk away from them when they leave the film set at the end of the day.</info>

Freddy still has one more plan on getting back to Elm Street. He resurrects Jason Voorhees and sends him off to kill. The more bodies which fall to the ground, the stronger in which Freddy becomes. This is until, Freddy realizes that Jason isn't going to step aside easily, and must be taken down himself.</info>
