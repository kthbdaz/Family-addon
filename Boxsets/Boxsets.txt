Hiccup's destiny of becoming a prized dragon fighter takes an unexpected diversion however when he saves and befriends an injured dragon named Toothless. Fed up with the old ways, Hiccup embarks on a mission of his own to convince his tribe to abandon its barbaric tradition of ruthless dragon-slaying. In 'How to Train Your Dragon 2', five years after having brought together dragons and Vikings on the island of Berk, Hiccup and Toothless are spending their days soaring through the clouds searching for unchartered lands. But after discovering a previously unknown cave where a large colony of wild dragons live, the pair soon find themselves at the heart of a new adventure as they try to keep the peace and attempt to change the future of humans and dragons forever.</info>

<info>The first four films from the 'Home Alone' series. In 'Home Alone' (1990) ten-year-old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) is banished to his room while his family prepare for a Christmas trip to Europe. He wakes up to find they have inadvertently left without him. Kevin must cope not only with life on his own but also with the threat of two persistent, albeit incompetent, burglars. Meanwhile, his parents try to find a way to get back home to their forgotten son. 'Home Alone 2' (1992) sees Kevin get separated from his family at Christmas time again. This time, they're in Florida and he's in New York, and the two bumbling gangsters from the first film (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) are out of jail and on Kevin's trail. In 'Home Alone 3' (1997) a band of hi-tech thieves have stolen a top-secret computer chip, and placed it inside a toy car. However, through a series of mishaps the car finds its way to Alex Pruitt (Alex D. Linz), who is alone at home with the chicken pox. The thieves track Alex down, but their attempts to retrieve the chip are all thwarted by the young whiz-kid. Finally, 'Home Alone 4' (2002) sees the return of Kevin McAllister (this time played by Mike Weinberg) who once again finds himself left alone in an empty house; this time it is a hi-tech safe-house, owned by the girlfriend of his recently divorced father. The house is being used by a royal heir and Kevin (in his usual style) manages to see off potential kidnappers whilst also making sure his parents get back together.</info>

<info>Starship Troopers is set in the future and follows a group of friends who join Earth's military forces after high school graduation. Their mission: to battle the insectoid Klendathu. One fights for the chance to be a renowned pilot (Denise Richards), one for revenge (Casper Van Dien), and one for the love of a good man (Dina Meyer), but interpersonal relationships take a back seat to the firepower leveled against (and returned from) the chitinous aliens. In Starship Troopers 2 - Hero of the Federation, the alien Bug horde is still the number one enemy. This time, directed by Phil Tippett, the visual effects wizard from the original movie (and also Star Wars and Indiana Jones), Hero of the Federation finds the mobile infantry unit of the Federation isolated light years away from reinforcements. They must seek the help of a Federation traitor if they are to have any hope of saving themselves and the human race. Casper Van Dien (star of the original) returns after over a decade for Starship Troopers 3 - Marauder, the second sequel to the alien-bug-battling, action-packed splatter-fest satire. After the celebrated Johnny Rico (Van Dien), now a colonel, attempts to defend the planet Roku San from some nasty arachnids, he finds himself put on death row for acting inappropriately during battle. But when a Federation starship piloted by tough soldier babe Lola Beck (Jolene Blalock, Enterprise) crashes on a far-away alien planet, only the bug-squashing Rico can save the day--the authorities have no choice but to release him for the mission. Armed with an impossibly advanced weapon known as the Marauder, Rico and his crew are prepared to exterminate by any means necessary. Starship Troopers: Invasion is the fourth movie in the Trooper franchise and the first to be animated just using CGI</info>

<info>NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM: Good-hearted dreamer, Larry Daley [Ben Stiller], despite being perpetually down on his luck, thinks he's destined for something big. But even he could never have imagined how big when he accepts what appears to be a menial job at a museum of natural history. During Larry's watch extraordinary things begin to occur: Mayans, Roman gladiators and cowboys emerge from their diorama to wage epic battles. In his quest for fire, a Neanderthal burns down his own display; Attila the Hun pillages his neighbouring exhibits and a T-Rex reminds everyone why he's history's fiercest predator. Amidst the chaos, the only person Larry can turn to for advice is a wax figure of President Teddy Roosevelt [Robin Williams] who helps our hero harness the bedlam, stop a nefarious plot and save the museum. NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM: BATTLE OF THE SMITHSONIAN: In addition to Ben Stiller, the cast will be rounded out by many from the original film as well as several new characters from history. The centrepiece of the film will be bringing to life the Smithsonian Institution, which houses the world's largest museum complex with more than 136 million items in its collections, ranging from the plane Amelia Earhart flew on her nonstop solo flight across the Atlantic and Al Capone's rap sheet and mug shot to Dorothy's ruby red slippers and Archie Bunker's lounge chair. No major film has ever shot inside the Smithsonian in Washington...until Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian. NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM: SECRET OF THE TOMB: If it's laughter you're after, get ready for the most hilarious night ever! Ben Stiller leads an all-star comedy cast, including Robin Williams, Owen Wilson, Rebel Wilson and Ricky Gervais, for one final, fun-filled Night at the Museum. This time, Larry Daley and his heroic friends embark on their greatest adventure yet as they travel to London in order to save the magic that brings the museum exhibits to life! </info>

With cameo appearances from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis, the film also sees Stallone and Schwarzenegger sharing a screen for the first time ever. In 'The Expendables 2' (2012) Mr Church (Willis) reunites the formidable Expendables team, plus new member Billy the Kid (Liam Hemsworth), for what should be a straightforward job. But when one of their number is murdered by adversary Jean Vilain (Jean-Claude Van Damme), the team's quest for revenge finds them pitted against an unexpected rival. In 'The Expendables 3' (2014) Barney Ross (Stallone) comes face-to-face with old nemesis Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson), with whom he originally formed the group of mercenaries known as the Expendables. However, when Stonebanks turned into a dangerous arms trader, Barney had no choice but to take him out and believed him to be dead - until now. With some new, younger additions to his team, Barney once again confronts Stonebanks but will the mission be a success this time?</info>

<info>Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane brings his boundary-pushing brand of humour to the big screen for the first time as writer, director and voice star of Ted. In the live action/CG-animated comedy, he tells the story of John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg), a grown man who must deal with the cherished teddy bear who came to life as the result of a childhood wish… and has refused to leave his side ever since.
