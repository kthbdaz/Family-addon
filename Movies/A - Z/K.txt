<info>The lovably simple residents of peaceful Kikoriki Island are thrown kicking and screaming into big adventure, when their resident scientist invents an amazing device - a helmet called "the Improverizor," which takes personality traits from one person and swaps them with traits of someone else. But when spineless young Wally tries to use the untested device to cure his cowardice, he ends up even more spineless - by getting accidentally body-switched with a squirmy little caterpillar. Now he has even more to fear than he could have ever imagined, and so do his fellow villagers, as they're dragged into a madcap adventure packed with plane crashes, mistaken identities, erupting volcanoes and angry primitives on the warpath. Boy, do the Kikoriki Crew wish they could switch place now - with anyone.</info>

<info>Set against the backdrop of an underground, bohemian London, Kids In Love offers a new take on the traditional coming of age story. Drifting through his gap year with internships and travel plans, Jack (Will Poulter) has always suspected there was more to life than this. A chance encounter with the beautiful and ethereal Evelyn (Alma Jodorowsky) and her friends, including free spirited Viola (Cara Delevingne), swerves his life radically off course. She is like no one he's ever met before, and he quickly becomes caught up in a whirlwind of all-day parties and wild nights in London's hidden dives with her charismatic friends. Giving up everything to follow Evelyn and her hedonistic lifestyle, it takes Jack a while to realise what he's leaving behind, that love isn't a game you want to lose and that these people might not be the kindred spirits he first thought.</info>

<info>Despite a mare of a season, loyal fans Wigsy (Warren Brown) and Cliff (Greg McHugh) join the thousands of adoring supporters each Saturday in the terraces to sing and cheer their boys to victory. But today is different. Today is important. Win: they stay up. Lose: they go down. In the dying moments of the match, unbelievable elation as their team score is immediately followed by unbelievable deflation as the Ref (Alistair Petrie) disallows the goal. This, compounded by a moody goal at the other end, sends the losing supporters into a rioting frenzy. Disenfranchised by the impotency of the rioting hooligans to cause any real change, but determined to right this injustice, Wigsy and the more reluctant Cliff inadvertently form their own two-man firm....and kidnap the referee.</info>
