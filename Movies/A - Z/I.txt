<info>In the winter of 1820, the New England whaling ship Essex was assaulted by something no one could believe: a whale of mammoth size and will, and an almost human sense of vengeance. The real-life maritime disaster would inspire Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. But that told only half the story. "In the Heart of the Sea" reveals the encounter's harrowing aftermath, as the ship's surviving crew is pushed to their limits and forced to do the unthinkable to stay alive. Braving storms, starvation, panic and despair, the men will call into question their deepest beliefs, from the value of their lives to the morality of their trade, as their captain searches for direction on the open sea and his first mate still seeks to bring the great whale down. </info>

<info>Brothers Jake and Ethan witness something crashing to earth and discover that it is a satellite of some kind. Being broke, they collect it and sell it to the local scrap dealer, Earl. Earl, meanwhile, has built an 18 foot "Golem" out of scrap iron to be used in the local town parade. The satellite is infected with some type of space bacteria which feeds on metal and also causes said metal to become animated. The result is that the Golem becomes infected, comes alive, and begins killing people by sucking the metals from their body with just a touch. Jake must find a way to defeat the Golem and save the town. </info>
