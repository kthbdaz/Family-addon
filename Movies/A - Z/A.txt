It's never easy being the new kid in school, but young Joey (Seeley) is determined to make the most of his new surroundings. If only he were to find a pretty girl who was willing to teach him the ropes around his new high school, Joey could finally stop fretting about fitting in. Perhaps Mary (Selena Gomez) is just such a girl, though this Cinderella is more likely to waltz in a new pair of dancing shoes than a pair of glass slipper. </info>

<info>In the 3D animated comedy, The Angry Birds Movie, we'll finally find out why the birds are so angry.

In this paradise, Red (Jason Sudeikis, We're the Millers, Horrible Bosses), a bird with a temper problem, speedy Chuck (Josh Gad in his first animated role since Frozen), and the volatile Bomb (Danny McBride, This is the End, Eastbound and Down) have always been outsiders. But when the island is visited by mysterious green piggies, it's up to these unlikely outcasts to figure out what the pigs are up to. Featuring a hilarious, all-star voice cast that includes Bill Hader (Trainwreck, Inside Out), Maya Rudolph (Bridesmaids, Sisters), and Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones), as well as Kate McKinnon (Saturday Night Live, Ghostbusters), Keegan-Michael Key (Key & Peele), Tony Hale (Veep, Arrested Development), Tituss Burgess (Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt), Ike Barinholtz (Neighbors, Sisters), .</info>

<info>Guy Carter is an award-winning graduate student of architecture. He's got a beautiful wife and a baby on the way. The problem? He doesn't have "his ducks in a row," which only fuels his doubts about being a good father. Guy has been trying to find work in his field for a year with no luck. At wit's end, his wife Anne finds him a job as a 'driver' on Craigslist. Guy shows up for the interview thinking he'll be delivering pizzas, but quickly realizes it's a job driving prostitutes. With money too scarce to turn down, he goes for it- which is where he meets Nikki, the tough-as-nails, unapologetic sex worker, and her two hilarious and foul-mouthed cohorts, Jaxi and Fallon. As reluctant driver and protector Guy is thrust into a world of rockin' women and feeble men. Over the course of one wild and sordid night, and several 'come-to-Jesus' moments, Guy proves to Nikki, and himself, that he does have what it takes to be the responsible father his family deserves. </info>

<info>A Legacy of Whining not only throws gasoline on the familiar cinematic trope of male mid-life crisis but watches gleefully as it sits back and throws a lighted match onto the proceedings. Inspired by its love of early 1970's American buddy films, this shaggy dog comedy (played out in one desperation-soaked dreamlike evening) tells the tale of two former high school friends, Mitch and Dunc, who reunite thirty years later in an attempt to resurrect the faded corpse of their "glory years" only to find, perhaps, that the past ain't all it's cracked up to be... "A Legacy of Whining" is really funny!"-

Runtime: 93 minutes

Adam Loule, 31, is trying to write the next great novel. It isn't going well. His previous books have all been failures, and now he's only surviving thanks to his girlfriend Tracy, 29, a successful lawyer. His blind obsession for greatness has recently put a strain on their relationship, not that Adam's noticed. He does however notice the beautiful and flattering Emma, 25, especially when she tells Adam she also goes by another name, Death...and she's here for him. Not surprisingly, Adam doesn't believe her, regardless of her infinite knowledge of his most embarrassing secrets, until she takes another guy whose time is up. As Adam descends into panic, Emma assures him death isn't all that bad. She's going to give him until tomorrow to finish his book, which will make him famous and become the classic he's always dreamed of writing. She can see the future after he dies when he isn't around to screw it up. Living only results in poverty and obscurity. Adam decides he'll take his chances and live, as what good is fame if you can't be around to bask in it. Adam pleads with Emma and she finally relents. If he can prove that living is better than his dreams coming true, she might let him live. Adam thinks about Tracy, but Emma doesn't buy it. Tracy's moving up in the world and is quickly going to tire of the supporting a struggling writer who doesn't notice her, and dreams of becoming George Clooney as soon as he's famous so women can get past the awkwardness and khakis. Realizing she might be right, Adam tries to make amends with Tracy, but unable to see Emma, she doesn't believe him and wonders if this is about another very real woman. After two years together, she wants to move on with life and is wondering if he's the guy to do it with. As Adam continues to try and find things worth living for, he begins to connect with Emma. The attraction is mutual. Emma wants to quit being Death, but is afraid to take the next step and has been looking for someone to go past the gates with. She wants to go with Adam. Suddenly, the afterlife isn't looking so bad. Torn between the two women, his desire for fame, and with dawn about to break, Adam must decide if what he's dreamed about is worth dying for, and if the woman he truly loves is in the present or the hereafter.</info>

One of the most successful filmed biographies of the 1940s, A Song to Remember alleges to be the true story of Polish composer Frederick Chopin. Actually, it has about as much relation to truth as a Heckle and Jeckle cartoon, but with such gorgeous creatures as Cornel Wilde and Merle Oberon in the leads, who cared? Though Wilde, as Chopin, is the nominal lead, top billing goes to Paul Muni, hamming his way through the role of Chopin's mentor Professor Joseph Elsner. Reportedly, Muni developed his characterization long before shooting started, refusing to allow the performances of the other actors to alter his interpretation in the slightest. This may explain why Muni seems to be acting in a vacuum, frequently completely out of rhythm with the film and its characters. Otherwise, Cornel Wilde does a nice job as the tempestuous Chopin, whose patriotic fervency frequently takes priority over his music. Merle Oberon plays novelist George Sand, who despite her preference for male clothing proves to be "all woman" during her torrid, decade-long affair with Chopin. The film's money scene--the one that everyone talked about, keeping the picture "alive" long after its original release--occurs towards the end, when the tubercular Chopin begins hemorrhaging as he performs his Polonaise for the first time (Jose Iturbi is heard on the soundtrack, "doubling" for Wilde's ivory-tickling). Sumptuously photographed in Technicolor by Tony Gaudio and Allen M. Davey, A Song to Remember was the usually penurious Columbia Pictures' top production of 1945. Fifteen years later, the studio hoped to make lightning strike twice with its Franz Liszt biopic Song Without End, but the magic just wasn't there.</info>
