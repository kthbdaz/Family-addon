<info>ChickLit is a comedy drama about four guys trying to save their local pub from closing down. They group write a chick lit, or more specifically a 'mummy porn' novel in the style of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' and it gets snapped up. The only snag is that the publisher insists that the young woman 'author' does press and publicity. The guys have to keep their involvement a secret and so engage an out of work actress to 'role play' the part of the author. This leads to her becoming the star in the film of the book, the tables are turned on the guys and she is in control - leaving them with the awful prospect of having to secretly churn out sex novels for the foreseeable future.</info>

<info>"Captain Sparky vs. The Flying Saucers" is a little add-on to Tim Burton's "Frankenweenie" and it shows us how Victor Frankenstein plays with his dog. The latter has to save the world in this scenario and, of course, he succeeds. I think this is a bonus feature on the DVD or Bluray, but it's not too popular, especially looking at how famous the movie was. So yeah, maybe it would have been more known if Burton had directed it as well. At least, it was done by people who also worked on the "real" movie. Charlie Tahan also speaks the character of Victor Frankenstein again. Still, I must say this is only a recommended watch for huge fans of the movie. Everybody else is not missing much as it adds basically nothing of value to the franchise. Thumbs down.</info>
