<info>There is greatness in a film that can be discussed, dissected, and talked about late into the night. Then there is genius that is right in front of our faces--you smile at the spell it puts you into and are refreshed, and not a word needs to be spoken. This kind of entertainment is what they used to call "movie magic" and there is loads of it in this irresistible computer animation feature. Just a picture of these bright toys on the cover of Toy Story looks intriguing as it reawakens the kid in us</info>

<info>Double bill of animated comedy adventures based on the children's novel by Cressida Cowell. In 'How to Train Your Dragon' (2010), teenaged Viking Hiccup (voice of Jay Baruchel), who lives on the windswept island of Berk where his father Stoic the Vast (Gerard Butler) is the tribe's feared chief, is busy fighting dragons as part of his warrior training. Hiccup's destiny of becoming a prized dragon fighter takes an unexpected diversion however when he saves and befriends an injured dragon named Toothless. Fed up with the old ways, Hiccup embarks on a mission of his own to convince his tribe to abandon its barbaric tradition of ruthless dragon-slaying. In 'How to Train Your Dragon 2', five years after having brought together dragons and Vikings on the island of Berk, Hiccup and Toothless are spending their days soaring through the clouds searching for unchartered lands. But after discovering a previously unknown cave where a large colony of wild dragons live, the pair soon find themselves at the heart of a new adventure as they try to keep the peace and attempt to change the future of humans and dragons forever.</info>

<info>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy tells the story of Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), a hobbit who battles against the Dark Lord Sauron to save his world, Middle-earth, from the grip of evil. In the films, Frodo and his fellowship of friends and allies embark on a desperate journey to rid Middle-earth of the source of Sauron's greatest strength, the One Ring--a ring that has the power to enslave the inhabitants of Middle-earth. The trilogy tells tales of extraordinary adventures across the treacherous landscape of Middle-earth and reveals how the power of friendship, love and courage can hold the forces of darkness at bay. Beside Wood, the films star Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, featuring Sean Bean, and Ian Holm, with Andy Serkis as Gollum. </info>

<info>The first four films from the 'Home Alone' series. In 'Home Alone' (1990) ten-year-old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) is banished to his room while his family prepare for a Christmas trip to Europe. He wakes up to find they have inadvertently left without him. Kevin must cope not only with life on his own but also with the threat of two persistent, albeit incompetent, burglars. Meanwhile, his parents try to find a way to get back home to their forgotten son. 'Home Alone 2' (1992) sees Kevin get separated from his family at Christmas time again. This time, they're in Florida and he's in New York, and the two bumbling gangsters from the first film (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) are out of jail and on Kevin's trail. In 'Home Alone 3' (1997) a band of hi-tech thieves have stolen a top-secret computer chip, and placed it inside a toy car. However, through a series of mishaps the car finds its way to Alex Pruitt (Alex D. Linz), who is alone at home with the chicken pox. The thieves track Alex down, but their attempts to retrieve the chip are all thwarted by the young whiz-kid. Finally, 'Home Alone 4' (2002) sees the return of Kevin McAllister (this time played by Mike Weinberg) who once again finds himself left alone in an empty house; this time it is a hi-tech safe-house, owned by the girlfriend of his recently divorced father. The house is being used by a royal heir and Kevin (in his usual style) manages to see off potential kidnappers whilst also making sure his parents get back together.</info>
