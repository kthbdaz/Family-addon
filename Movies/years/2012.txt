<info>Holly Hamilton is a fearsomely independent teenage girl who is always helping the people she cares about, often using her expert computer hacking skills to do so: whether it's hacking into a college database to see if her best friend Blake got an early acceptance, or by defrauding a health insurance corporation to help her very sick grandmother get a kidney transplant. She's not afraid to break the law a little, as long as it means helping someone she loves. But her luck takes an incredibly bad turn when she and Blake go to a rave to celebrate Blake getting into college, and Blake meets a mysterious older man who kills her by slipping her an overdose of a date rape drug. What's even worse is that this man then attacks Holly and frames her for the crime! And because of Holly's less than lawful behavior in the past, the cops are convinced that she is responsible for her best friend's death. But then one day, while she is getting transferred to juvenile hall, a breakout attempt happens ... </info>

Two thousand years ago, Nhagruul the Foul, a sorcerer who reveled in corrupting the innocent and the spread of despair, neared the end of his mortal days and was dismayed. Consumed by hatred for the living, Nhagruul sold his soul to the demon Lords of the abyss so that his malign spirit would survive. In an excruciating ritual, Nhagrulls skin was flayed into pages, his bones hammered into a cover, and his diseased blood became the ink to pen a book most vile. All those exposed to the book were driven to madness or so corrupted by the wicked knowledge contained within that they had no choice but to turn evil. Misery and bloodshed followed the disciples of Nhagruul as they spread their Masters dark dream. Creatures vile and depraved rose from every pit and unclean barrow to partake in the fever of destruction. The cities and kingdoms of Karkoth were consumed by this plague of evil until an order of warriors arose from the ashes. The Knights of the New Sun swore an oath to resurrect hope...</info>
