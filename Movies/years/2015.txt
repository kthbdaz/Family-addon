Genre: Drama , Science Fiction & Fantasy , Romance 
Directed By:Geordie Sabbagh 
Runtime: 93 minutes

Adam Loule, 31, is trying to write the next great novel. It isn't going well. His previous books have all been failures, and now he's only surviving thanks to his girlfriend Tracy, 29, a successful lawyer. His blind obsession for greatness has recently put a strain on their relationship, not that Adam's noticed. He does however notice the beautiful and flattering Emma, 25, especially when she tells Adam she also goes by another name, Death...and she's here for him. Not surprisingly, Adam doesn't believe her, regardless of her infinite knowledge of his most embarrassing secrets, until she takes another guy whose time is up. As Adam descends into panic, Emma assures him death isn't all that bad. She's going to give him until tomorrow to finish his book, which will make him famous and become the classic he's always dreamed of writing. She can see the future after he dies when he isn't around to screw it up. Living only results in poverty and obscurity. Adam decides he'll take his chances and live, as what good is fame if you can't be around to bask in it. Adam pleads with Emma and she finally relents. If he can prove that living is better than his dreams coming true, she might let him live. Adam thinks about Tracy, but Emma doesn't buy it. Tracy's moving up in the world and is quickly going to tire of the supporting a struggling writer who doesn't notice her, and dreams of becoming George Clooney as soon as he's famous so women can get past the awkwardness and khakis. Realizing she might be right, Adam tries to make amends with Tracy, but unable to see Emma, she doesn't believe him and wonders if this is about another very real woman. After two years together, she wants to move on with life and is wondering if he's the guy to do it with. As Adam continues to try and find things worth living for, he begins to connect with Emma. The attraction is mutual. Emma wants to quit being Death, but is afraid to take the next step and has been looking for someone to go past the gates with. She wants to go with Adam. Suddenly, the afterlife isn't looking so bad. Torn between the two women, his desire for fame, and with dawn about to break, Adam must decide if what he's dreamed about is worth dying for, and if the woman he truly loves is in the present or the hereafter.</info>

<info>Despite a mare of a season, loyal fans Wigsy (Warren Brown) and Cliff (Greg McHugh) join the thousands of adoring supporters each Saturday in the terraces to sing and cheer their boys to victory. But today is different. Today is important. Win: they stay up. Lose: they go down. In the dying moments of the match, unbelievable elation as their team score is immediately followed by unbelievable deflation as the Ref (Alistair Petrie) disallows the goal. This, compounded by a moody goal at the other end, sends the losing supporters into a rioting frenzy. Disenfranchised by the impotency of the rioting hooligans to cause any real change, but determined to right this injustice, Wigsy and the more reluctant Cliff inadvertently form their own two-man firm....and kidnap the referee.</info>

<info>In the winter of 1820, the New England whaling ship Essex was assaulted by something no one could believe: a whale of mammoth size and will, and an almost human sense of vengeance. The real-life maritime disaster would inspire Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. But that told only half the story. "In the Heart of the Sea" reveals the encounter's harrowing aftermath, as the ship's surviving crew is pushed to their limits and forced to do the unthinkable to stay alive. Braving storms, starvation, panic and despair, the men will call into question their deepest beliefs, from the value of their lives to the morality of their trade, as their captain searches for direction on the open sea and his first mate still seeks to bring the great whale down. </info>
