<info>"Captain Sparky vs. The Flying Saucers" is a little add-on to Tim Burton's "Frankenweenie" and it shows us how Victor Frankenstein plays with his dog. The latter has to save the world in this scenario and, of course, he succeeds. I think this is a bonus feature on the DVD or Bluray, but it's not too popular, especially looking at how famous the movie was. So yeah, maybe it would have been more known if Burton had directed it as well. At least, it was done by people who also worked on the "real" movie. Charlie Tahan also speaks the character of Victor Frankenstein again. Still, I must say this is only a recommended watch for huge fans of the movie. Everybody else is not missing much as it adds basically nothing of value to the franchise. Thumbs down.</info>

<info>When monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, started rising from the sea, a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes - a washed up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) - who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse</info>

<info>When a tornado appears in the waters south of Boston, former storm chaser Joe Randall is intrigued by the unusual weather. But as twisters begin to strike across the Boston shoreline, Joe quickly realizes this is no ordinary storm front. As the storms threaten to move inland, the citizens of Boston find themselves trapped in a tempest turning deadlier by the minute. With the city under siege, Joe, his sister Maddy and his old storm chasing partner Lee realize they're dealing with a never before seen weather phenomenon known as Stonados. The only chance of stopping the storm is an untested theory about weather manipulation... the same theory that Joe has been trying to prove for over a decade. But with the storm spreading and threatening the entire Eastern Seaboard-as well as Joe's children who are trapped in a storm-besieged stadium-Joe and his motley crew will have to give it a try, either saving the world... or accelerating its destruction!</info>
