Going to Ohio State to train under its track and field coach, Larry Snyder, the young African American athlete quickly impresses with his tremendous potential that suggests Olympic material. However, as Owens struggles both with the obligations of his life and the virulent racism against him, the question of whether America would compete at all at the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany is being debated vigorously. When the American envoy finds a compromise persuasive with the Third Reich to avert a boycott, Owens has his own moral struggle about going. Upon resolving that issue, Owens and his coach travel to Berlin to participate in a competition that would mark Owens as the greatest of America's Olympians even as the German film director, Leni Riefenstahl, locks horns with her country's Propaganda Minister, Josef Goebbels, to film the politically embarrassing fact for posterity.</info>

<info>In Disney's "Alice Through the Looking Glass," an all-new spectacular adventure featuring the unforgettable characters from Lewis Carroll's beloved stories, Alice returns to the whimsical world of Underland and travels back in time to save the Mad Hatter. Directed by James Bobin, who brings his own unique vision to the spectacular world Tim Burton created on screen in 2010 with "Alice in Wonderland," the film is written by Linda Woolverton based on characters created by Lewis Carroll and produced by Joe Roth, Suzanne Todd and Jennifer Todd and Tim Burton with John G. Scotti serving as executive producer. "Alice Through the Looking Glass" reunites the all-star cast from the worldwide blockbuster phenomenon, including: Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway, Mia Wasikowska and Helena Bonham Carter along with the voices of Alan Rickman, Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen and Timothy Spall. We are also introduced to several new characters: Zanik Hightopp (Rhys Ifans), the Mad Hatter's father and Time himself (Sacha Baron Cohen), a peculiar creature who is part human, part clock. Alice Kingsleigh (Wasikowska) has spent the past few years following in her father's footsteps and sailing the high seas. Upon her return to London, she comes across a magical looking glass and returns to the fantastical realm of Underland and her friends the White Rabbit (Sheen), Absolem (Rickman), the Cheshire Cat (Fry) and the Mad Hatter (Depp), who is not himself. The Hatter has lost his Muchness, so Mirana (Hathaway) sends Alice on a quest to borrow the Chronosphere, a metallic globe inside the chamber of the Grand Clock which powers all time. Returning to the past, she comes across friends - and enemies - at different points in their lives, and embarks on a perilous race to save the Hatter before time runs out. Presented in Digital 3D(TM), Real D 3D and IMAX (R) 3D, Disney's "Alice Through the Looking Glass" opens in U.S. theaters on May 27, 2016.</info>

One of the most successful filmed biographies of the 1940s, A Song to Remember alleges to be the true story of Polish composer Frederick Chopin. Actually, it has about as much relation to truth as a Heckle and Jeckle cartoon, but with such gorgeous creatures as Cornel Wilde and Merle Oberon in the leads, who cared? Though Wilde, as Chopin, is the nominal lead, top billing goes to Paul Muni, hamming his way through the role of Chopin's mentor Professor Joseph Elsner. Reportedly, Muni developed his characterization long before shooting started, refusing to allow the performances of the other actors to alter his interpretation in the slightest. This may explain why Muni seems to be acting in a vacuum, frequently completely out of rhythm with the film and its characters. Otherwise, Cornel Wilde does a nice job as the tempestuous Chopin, whose patriotic fervency frequently takes priority over his music. Merle Oberon plays novelist George Sand, who despite her preference for male clothing proves to be "all woman" during her torrid, decade-long affair with Chopin. The film's money scene--the one that everyone talked about, keeping the picture "alive" long after its original release--occurs towards the end, when the tubercular Chopin begins hemorrhaging as he performs his Polonaise for the first time (Jose Iturbi is heard on the soundtrack, "doubling" for Wilde's ivory-tickling). Sumptuously photographed in Technicolor by Tony Gaudio and Allen M. Davey, A Song to Remember was the usually penurious Columbia Pictures' top production of 1945. Fifteen years later, the studio hoped to make lightning strike twice with its Franz Liszt biopic Song Without End, but the magic just wasn't there.</info>

Runtime: 93 minutes

Adam Loule, 31, is trying to write the next great novel. It isn't going well. His previous books have all been failures, and now he's only surviving thanks to his girlfriend Tracy, 29, a successful lawyer. His blind obsession for greatness has recently put a strain on their relationship, not that Adam's noticed. He does however notice the beautiful and flattering Emma, 25, especially when she tells Adam she also goes by another name, Death...and she's here for him. Not surprisingly, Adam doesn't believe her, regardless of her infinite knowledge of his most embarrassing secrets, until she takes another guy whose time is up. As Adam descends into panic, Emma assures him death isn't all that bad. She's going to give him until tomorrow to finish his book, which will make him famous and become the classic he's always dreamed of writing. She can see the future after he dies when he isn't around to screw it up. Living only results in poverty and obscurity. Adam decides he'll take his chances and live, as what good is fame if you can't be around to bask in it. Adam pleads with Emma and she finally relents. If he can prove that living is better than his dreams coming true, she might let him live. Adam thinks about Tracy, but Emma doesn't buy it. Tracy's moving up in the world and is quickly going to tire of the supporting a struggling writer who doesn't notice her, and dreams of becoming George Clooney as soon as he's famous so women can get past the awkwardness and khakis. Realizing she might be right, Adam tries to make amends with Tracy, but unable to see Emma, she doesn't believe him and wonders if this is about another very real woman. After two years together, she wants to move on with life and is wondering if he's the guy to do it with. As Adam continues to try and find things worth living for, he begins to connect with Emma. The attraction is mutual. Emma wants to quit being Death, but is afraid to take the next step and has been looking for someone to go past the gates with. She wants to go with Adam. Suddenly, the afterlife isn't looking so bad. Torn between the two women, his desire for fame, and with dawn about to break, Adam must decide if what he's dreamed about is worth dying for, and if the woman he truly loves is in the present or the hereafter.</info>
