<info>Young Howard Lovecraft begins his adventure by going to the Butler Sanitarium with his mother to visit his father Winfield Lovecraft, a patient there who has been driven mad by something he's done. Howard's father goes into a spasm of paranoia and fear, begging his son to destroy a book that he should have never written. The boy doesn't scream during the incident, but does go home with a small gift - a paper star made by his father. Once home, Howard's curiosity is too much and he begins to read his father's book. He's drawn into a dark, cold world of magic and deceit. The book tells of a place - R'yleh - a "kingdom described as an unholy marriage of fairy tales and nightmares." Unwittingly, the boy reads a few words written in the book in a strange language - and is sucked through a whole in the fabric of the universe. He meets a Deep One, Thu Thu Hmong, who initially tries to eat Howard but comes around after the boy saves the creature's life. Howard, who fails to pronounce the creature's name, simply calls him Spot. From that point on, things get very interesting for the young Lovecraft as he is drawn into the intrigue of a strange new world. Howard, accompanied by Spot, meets local children named Felch, Davik, Tw'i and Nes. These four children give Howard the education needed to begin his journey in the Kingdom of R'yleh. When Howard and Spot get to the Frozen Castle they meet Algid Bunk, the Earl working under King Alzhared. Guided by Algid, Howard and Spot must uncover the dark secrets of R'yleh in order for Howard to get back home to his family.

After visiting his father in Arkham Sanitarium, young Howard Lovecraft accidentally uses the legendary Necronomicon to open a portal to a strange frozen world filled with horrifying creatures and a great adventure.

It begins with an abstract battle of light and darkness set to the music of Beethoveen's Fifth Symphony. Then we see the adventures of a Humpback Whale calf and his pod set to "The Pines of Rome." Next is the humourous story of several lives in 1930's New York City, scored with "Rhapsody in Blue." Following is a musical telling of the fairy tale, "The Steadfast Tin Soldier" set to Dmitri Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 2. Then a goofy Flamingo causes havoc in his flock with his yo-yo to the tune of the finale of "Carnival of the Animals." This is followed by the classic sequence from the original film, "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" starring Mickey Mouse and followed by "Pomp and Circumstance" starring Donald Duck as a harried assistant to Noah on his Ark. Finally, we see the awesome tale of the life, death and renewal of a forest in a sequence ...</info>

<info>"Captain Sparky vs. The Flying Saucers" is a little add-on to Tim Burton's "Frankenweenie" and it shows us how Victor Frankenstein plays with his dog. The latter has to save the world in this scenario and, of course, he succeeds. I think this is a bonus feature on the DVD or Bluray, but it's not too popular, especially looking at how famous the movie was. So yeah, maybe it would have been more known if Burton had directed it as well. At least, it was done by people who also worked on the "real" movie. Charlie Tahan also speaks the character of Victor Frankenstein again. Still, I must say this is only a recommended watch for huge fans of the movie. Everybody else is not missing much as it adds basically nothing of value to the franchise. Thumbs down.</info>
