<info>Prepare for plenty of music, lots of dancing, and even a little magic in this reworking of the Cinderella legend featuring High School Musical star Drew Seeley as a young Prince Charming in search of the ideal girl. It's never easy being the new kid in school, but young Joey (Seeley) is determined to make the most of his new surroundings. If only he were to find a pretty girl who was willing to teach him the ropes around his new high school, Joey could finally stop fretting about fitting in. Perhaps Mary (Selena Gomez) is just such a girl, though this Cinderella is more likely to waltz in a new pair of dancing shoes than a pair of glass slipper. </info>

Upon their entrance, the disparate group have a few things in common: they've got "big dreams" and they "want fame". Some have natural talent, some have had to obtain talent through hard work and training, and some show only some promise which the teachers hope will materialize into true talent. Some have full support from their parents, some have support from their parents but only for the parents' specific dreams, and some have little or no parental support whatsoever. Some have formal training, some not. Some are confident of what they can do, some believe they are limited and are at school to expand those talents, while others have no confidence whatsoever. And some are clear about where they want to "be" after graduation, while some want to explore whatever other opportunities may arise for them</info>

<info>Classic tale of teenage rebellion and repression features a delightful combination of dance choreography and realistic and touching performances. When teenager Ren McCormack and his family move from big-city Chicago to a small Midwestern town, he's in for a real case of culture shock. Though he tries hard to fit in, the streetwise Ren can't quite believe he's living in a place where rock music and dancing are illegal. However, there is one small pleasure: Ariel Moore, a troubled but lovely blonde with a jealous boyfriend. And a Bible-thumping minister, who is responsible for keeping the town dance-free. Ren and his classmates want to do away with this ordinance, especially since the senior prom is around the corner, but only Ren has the courage to initiate a battle to abolish the outmoded ban and revitalize the spirit of the repressed townspeople. Fast-paced drama is filled with such now-famous hit songs as the title track and "Let's Hear It for the Boy".</info>
