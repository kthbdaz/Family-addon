<info>Pilot - Part 1
Six people awaken from stasis to find they are on a ship in space but have no idea who they are. They are then attacked by an android and later shot at by another ship. After escaping, they arrive at their ship's intended destination: a colony on a planet waiting for a shipment of weapons like the one they are carrying, to defend from an approaching threat. They then learn from the decrypted ship's files that five of them are wanted murderers and they're not, as they had believed, here to help the people in question: they're here to kill them. </info>
