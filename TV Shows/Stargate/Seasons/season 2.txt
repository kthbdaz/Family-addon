<info>In the Line of Duty
During a visit to the Nasyan planet, under the first goa'uld attack in centuries, a victim's breath given mouth-to-mouth infects Sam, at first unnoticed. Soon her behavior changes, more military and assertive, and she seems to suffer from amnesia. Cassie senses immediately Sam really hosts a goa'uld, which is confirmed by her attempt at gunpoint to escape via the star-gate, and since the aliens now seem able to enter via small skin wounds as in her throat, Dr. Fraser points out there may be others in the base. Sam is jailed but allegedly hosts Jolinar, a 'Tok'ra' or good, anti-warlord goa'uld underground rebel, being chased by an 'ashrak', a goa'uld hit man, who has already started his deadly assignment on earth... </info>

Teal'c vows to shun her forever after Rya'c's salvation from Apophis's palace, but the boy refuses to come with his 'hataka' (traitor) father and calls the guards so they must retreat without him and soon see him in Apophis' propaganda, however a deliberate wrong detail suggests he has not completely changed sides yet.

Now Jack mistrusts the return of Rya'c too, Teal'c refuses to doubt his son; the others hesitate, and after their return on earth with the boy</info>

When Teal'c makes Sam Carter realize how valuable the knowledge left by Tok'ra Jolinar in her brain and the chance for an alliance can be, they convince general Hammond to let SG-1 attempt a meeting. They arrive on a planet which is deserted on the surface, but are awaited by well-camouflaged, armed Tok'ra who bring them to tunnels which they create by means of a mysterious crystal, which can also undo them afterward. Both parties are quiet suspicious, the team feels like captives, and indeed the Tok'ra leader Yosuuf fears they cannot be released at least until the whole site is moved. Meanwhile the Tauri (earthlings) barely overcome their suspicion against the Tok'ra Goa'uld biology (with symbiont), when already asked to volunteer themselves as 'hosts', and Carter learns Martouf (alias Lantash, symbiotically) was Jolinar's lover, hence has a special connection with her...</info>

The next planet visited by SG-1 holds an unusual surprise: the only person by its star-gate is an old, sick man, known to Teal'c as Machello, since decades a famous adversary of the goa'uld, who even developed his own technology to fight them, was captured and tortured but escaped. He joins them to earth, but Daniel, who touched his recording device, wakes up in the dying body of Machello, which is only discovered after the alien walked of, given a clean bill of health by Dr. Fraiser, in Daniel's body, determined to enjoy life as an earthling, teaming up with homeless Fred, which soon turns bad... While Machello is searched, the others travel back to retrieve the device, but in the process Jack and Teal'c get body-switched too, and Sam fails to figure out on her own how to reverse it...

Following on a Tok'ra tip, SG-1 goes to a planet where they find the hated Apophis, nearly dying and under attack by death-gliders. They get back with him, realizing he was tortured by a rival system-lord, with lasting harm. Apophis demands sanctuary, provided Dr. Fraiser can save his life, at least on account of the human host, but without a sarcophagus the prognosis for his symbiont is lousy; he offers all his Goa'uld knowledge in exchange for a new host, i.e. his life, revealing he was defeated by the terrible Sokar, once supreme system lord till an alliance lead by Ra and Apophis unseated him. The confrontation with Daniel, on account on Amaunet/Sha're and their son Klorel, and with former prime Teal'c, is bitter for all three. The Tok'ra send Martouf, to warn the Taurai must hand over Apophis, but their warning is ignored- until Sokar proves he can bombard the iris with accelerated particles and ultimately cut trough it, so the White House orders his extradition, but before they ..</info>

Even taking one native to the base, Dr. Frazier fails to find their functioning or cure. Fearing to be infected, Jack and Daniel return too; Teal'c has only a short attack, while minding the strange plant as Daniel asked, and precisely it's symbiosis proves crucial...</info>

However Major General Trofsky, the new base commander, and his female assistant tell Daniel and Sam, in different sections, that each of them is the sole survivor: it's all make-believe to probe their brains about the weaknesses of earth and the Alliance of the four races.
