The SGC-base is approached by an al-kesh bomber which lets itself be taken down, so they can capture Ba'al, who offers to exchange the necessary information to find Merlin's weapon for human help to eliminate his clones, which want to kill him. They mistrust his story, as does NIS-agent Malcolm Barrett, who however fails to take over the investigation. Since the captive might actually be a clone, several missions to different planets retrieve and capture all clones, but which is the real Ba'al, and what are his true intentions? </info>

<info>Counterstrike 
On a planet where thousands were embracing the faith of Origin, a single wave of energy -destroying only living tissue- kills them all and the Prior. General Landry hears from Master Bra'tac, who is out of favor with the new leadership, and then its chief Se'tak, that it was ordered by the Jaffa council which intends to stop the Ori at all cost, using the ancient weapon from Dakara which successfully eliminated the Replicators. Teal'c and Mitchell on the empty Ori ship are captured by certain members of Bo'rel's armed Free Jaffa force; Daniel and Vala too, but their Jaffa captors fall prey in turn to Vala's evil Ori-daughter Adria, the sole survivor from the force wave. Against Landry's advice Se'tak orders to use the weapon at full power, which should destroy the planet and all ships around it, from which the Odyssey can evacuate the SG-1 members using the rings just in time, but it has no effect on the Ori ship, which in turn fires on the weapon on Dakara..</info>

When Vala has a dinner with Daniel, she is kidnapped by the Trust, interrogated, and dumped with almost total amnesia, as waitress in a diner, where she does however demonstrate to have retained her fighting skills when a robber has the misfortune to come during her shift. Even after Daniel figures out which Goa'ulds on Earth -including Athena, and especially Ba'al- can be involved, it proves difficult to retrieve her. And when Mitchell does, she suspiciously takes him captured, badly wounded.</info>

While Lt. Colonel Carter is aboard the Odyssey, it hits a minefield and loses contact with Earth. They are captured by the Lucian Anateo, who kills the ship commander Emerson, and ultimately wants to replace Nethan, whose leadership of the Lucian Alliance is highly contested. The other team members have no starship available, but Vala 'finds' a lousy Goa'uld craft and, with Daniel, Mitchell and Teal'c, tracks the Odyssey's signal to her dodgy acquaintance Shamus, only to be trapped there and brought to Anateo, but escape in a Ha'tak vessel. Col. Mitchell uses a hallucinogen to make Nethan believe he is the mysterious Lucian Kefflin, finds Teal'c a captive and 'takes over' his torture, but is recognized by a space pirate Tenak who knows him as a bounty-hunter and just wants a cut... </info>

<info>The Quest: Part 1 
A dream reveal to Vala Morgan Lefay's clues to three planets must be combined to one Stargate address containing symbols for each, and only one qualifies- when they arrive, the local medieval society tells them a week earlier Ba'al was there, and warns nobody ever returned from the quest. The arrival of an Ori force to impose conversion convinces the local library's guardian Orsic, who shows a parchment with cryptic instructions for the Arthurian quest based on five virtues, to help them look for the Sangrail. The first obstacle is a maze through a time distortion field, which leads them to Ba'al, already trapped for three days by a chest which contains nothing, but releases them if everyone puts something in it. Daniel then realizes Orsic is not a local but a disguised Ori, and indeed it's Adria, who decided to enlist them since the prophecy requires searchers of pure hearts, so they solve the next riddles together, practicing each of the virtues.</info>

They escape, but the dragon follows them outside. Ba'al admits not to know its secret name, while Daniel believes that the name probably holds power over it. While they guess, Cam thinks of luring the dragon to blow it up, but the C4 barely impresses its digestion. Daniel makes it disappear by using Morgan LeFay's name in Ancient, Ganos Lal.

<info>Line in the Sand
When an entire people may suffer the fatal wrath of a Prior of the Ori for not converting, General Landry orders Carter to try out an experimental device based on Merlin's technology to transport their whole village. The test works, but before they can activate it on a sufficiently large scale, an Ori force takes the village, wounds Sam and kills villagers near the Stargate before Vala's very eyes. Her husband, Tomin, captures her but claims to not love her. He is ordered, as punishment for being deceived by her, to re-educate her. Sam and Cam are able to activate the functioning part of the device, so their building is cloaked from the Ori, who threaten the village leaders and discover and arrest Teal'c. Even after the remaining villagers bow in submission, the Prior decides to destroy everyone since he couldn't find Sam, which makes Tomin doubt his faith, inform Vala, and confront the Prior. The villagers want to sacrifice Teal'c, but one leader stops them. Having seen the Prior .</info>

<info>The Road Not Taken
After an experiment to increase the range of Merlin's device goes terribly wrong, Sam has an accident which transports her to a parallel universe, where SG-1 has a very different composition, since history was changed by a failed attack by one Ori ship... and a whole fleet is expected soon. She insists upon abandoning the -killed- parallel Carter's line of work and pursues hiding the entire parallel Earth. It works! Even when the Ori fire at their position, nobody is hurt. The parallel Hank Landry is President, and three years prior had imposed permanent Martial Law. The more Carter learns about the perversion of civil liberties, the more she shifts her efforts, even when rewarded by a post as Presidential Defense Adviser, to restoring them, but thus incurs the active wrath of those in power who are eager to remain so. Time to get back, but how?</info>

<info>The Shroud 
Daniel Jackson, who was left behind fighting off Adria while the other SG1-members escaped through the Stargate, is found working as a Prior: the best in the business, who doesn't need to use any threats to talk people into conversion to Origin. Hoping there is still some of his personality left, the team (plus General Jack O'Neill) kidnaps him. Daniel explains how he temporarily has Merlin's personality and knowledge in himself, and had deliberately allowed Adria to turn him into a Prior, while delaying to finish Merlin's weapon she'd wanted, meanwhile hoping to get an Ori ship for Earth's side. But time is running out, since the team took unexpectedly long to capture him. Still, the generals, Carter, and Vala are most reluctant to go along with releasing him and opening the wormhole he needs to bring the weapon through. Even the White House wants to kill him, or at best, keep him in stasis until he is reverted to his human nature by Merlin's genetic manipulation. But then his plan ..</info>

Information from resistance on another planet indicates Arkad is in league with the Ori and a plan to attack Earth.

General Landry asks Dr. Lam to help him resume contact with her mother Kim, his ex. Even after the cargoes are found and blown up, Vala abhors her dad's entry. The general asks her to go easy on him, realizing that he, too, neglected his daughter because of his career, even if Jacek's neglect was just criminal. When Cam and Daniel go tell Jacek he shouldn't scam people, he tricks them into talking to Vala for him. Vala goes over just for catharsis, telling him she's through picking up the pieces of his tricks, and he certainly keeps scamming- as Daniel also finds even with Terak, a Jaffa from an escaped cargo ship, who hopes to sell the naquadah.

Vala tells her scary daughter how she helped Daniel, after a dream, reading the mysterious clava thessara-symbol's mystery, which led to a single planet address, where Athena's treasure house must be; after a disastrous visit there, the team refused to follow the next interpretation, fearing it's just a trap set up by Adria, so Vala is declared a security risk, grounded and confined to Area 51, but escapes through the Stargate. Adria takes her along as she hears the team still plans to visit the address, by starship. Upon arrival, they are trapped by SG-1, which however finds itself surrounded by lord Ba'al's troops. Ba'al uses the rings to beam up Adria into an electromagnetic cage in his starship. Back on Earth, General Landry worries what damage the two might do together and wants Adria back.
