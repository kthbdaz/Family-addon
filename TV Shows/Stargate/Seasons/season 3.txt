<info>Seth
Stargate is visited by general Jacob Carter on a mission -actually requested by his symbiont Selmak, who wants him to deal with his long-repressed break-up with Sam's brother Mark- to ask SG-1's help in the hunt for the sole system-lord the Tok'Ra never tracked down, Seth, the Egyptian god of chaos and total evil, who plausibly never left earth but hides as Ra put a high price on his head. Daniel finds a plausible series of Seth-cults, each ending in a blood-bad for followers, the latest being outside Seattle, led by Seth Fargo. Jacob and SG-1 arrange to take over the case jurisdiction from the ATF by presidential intervention. As Daniel predicts, they find escape tunnels and get in, but are awaited and disarmed, to be exposed to nish'ta, a powerful biological submission drug, and when Seth senses Jolinar's traces destined for elimination.</info>

<info>Fair Game 
Just when Jack was to speech, in the Secretary of Defense's presence, for Sam's promotion to major, he is suddenly beamed up directly into the space-ship in undetectable earth-orbit of Asgard Thor, who warns him the Goa'uld system-lords have decided after Hathor's defeat to launch an attack on earth hundredfold Apophis's and offers Asgard help to propose alternatively Earth's inclusion in the Protected Planets Treaty, then returns Jack. Thor instructs Jack alone to represent the entire planet, on star-base, against a System-lords delegation of three: the Ancient first supreme Greek god Cronos, who once toppled Sokar, Yu the Great or Yu-huang Shang Ti, the first Chinese dragon Emperor, and Nirrti, the Hindu goddess of darkness. The system-lords are rude and difficult. Teal'c hates Cronus above all because his father, once his prime, was killed as punishment for failure and Sam believes he ordered Jolinar's execution. Thor explains the Asgard really bluff against the feudally divided</info>

<info>Point of View 
The quantum mirror Daniel found in "There But for the Grace of God" brings to Area 51 an alternate Kawalsky and Dr. Carter from another reality, this time one where Sam never joined the military but became Jack's wife and the Goa'uld just overran earth. Dr. Carter begins suffering from temporal entropic cascade failure, a paradoxical effect of having two versions of the same person in the same reality and realises that she must return to her own reality or both Sams will eventually perish. SG-1 embark to the alternate reality to intercede and prevent the Goa'uld from conquering Earth before our General Hammond has the mirror disabled. The alternative Teal'c remained Apophis's loyal first prime, so the 'real' one can assume his identity to infiltrate the invading force but they are discovered and captured, but this only serves as the ideal diversion while the Sams also contact the alternate Asgard.</info>

<info>Demons
SG-1 lands on a planet where a culturally 'medieval Catholic' community lives in fear of a demon of Unas's species, which regularly collects human sacrifices to Satan, in fact hosts for system lord Sokar's army. When Simon implores SG-1 to spare his beloved Mary and take him instead, they even nurse her chicken pox. Simon hopes they are sent by God to deliver them from the satanic burden, but the canon who rules the village as 'spiritual' leader faithful to Sokar fears his authority challenged, which rests on his right to select the 'damned soul' to be sacrificed, declares Teal'c a demon and incarcerates all SG-1. Witch-trial-type ordeals see the Jaffa 'proven' a demon and executed by drowning, Daniel refuses the canon's to leave immediately. When Teal'c's symbiont allows a resurrection even Sam hadn't expected, they are all designated possessed and sacrificed, yet Mary is also. Simon follows the Unas with a staff weapon to liberate them, but he's not alone...</info>

Responding to a help cry from Kasuf, SG-1 and more USAF wipe out a Goa'uld Jaffa guard to save most Abydonian slaves. When Amaunet turns her hand device on Daniel, he can't bring himself to shoot his beloved wife Sha're, but Tel'c saves him by fatally staff-shooting her; Abydononian funeral tradition squashes his hope of a sarcophagus resurrection. Crushed by grief, Daniel has apparitions by Sha're and once released from hospital resigns from SGC, claiming the quest for his wife was his reason to join; his former research assistant Dr. Robert Rothman succeeds him in SG-1; Jack is sure he'll be back. Sha're (or Ammaunet's posthumous manual spell?) keeps appearing to Daniel life-like, telling him to forgive Teal'c and together find their boy, who as Harsisis has all the Goa'uld knowledge in his genetic memory, punishable by death. Daniel agrees to return, but has his secret agenda too.</info>

<info>Jolinar's Memories
Martouf leads a Tok'ra delegation with crushing news for Carter: her father Jacob/Selmak has been captured by Sokar and imprisoned on Netu, an Egyptian name for hell, on a moon of planet Delmal, from where nobody returns to suffer eternal torture, only Jolinar ever escaped. SG-1 mounts a rescue operation with Martouf, top-priority being any information Selmak can offer about Sokar's plan to subjugate the other system lords, an unprecedented threat for all humanoids in the galaxy. Teal'c must pilot a goa'uld ship and keep it in orbit as landing is impossible except by small pod, but first Martouf taps into Jolinar's memory, which is partially blocked by some trauma beyond physical torture. Only when they're down and in custody of Netu's lord Bynarr, Sam realizes he is the key, in a 'personal' way, but not voluntary as she thought. Sokar learns their presence from Bynnar and orders team and craft destroyed, but this also means there must be a way out. Bynarr's prime Na'onak has and is ..</info>

Now Apophis has revealed himself, he promises the prisoners to overturn Sokar, which requires extracting an irresistibly valuable secret, to which end he drugs Sam with the truth serum 'blood of Sokar' and implants a memory device plus the drug to torture Jack in the persona of his dead kid son and Daniel for the location of his Harsesis son; Martouf's love for Jolinar makes him betray the Tok'ra are on planet Etnac- a convincing lie, so Apophis's plan to earn Sokar's gratitude and then kill him when rewarded with the lordship of Netu is on a shaky basis... Teal'c must help the Tok'ra Aldwin prepare a nuclear weapon to explode the whole moon, as last chance to eliminate Sokar when his ship arrives, but decides to rescue SG-1 instead by flying in the path of the rings device to Sokar's ship..</info>

After a vain search for the Harsesis boy on an unexplored planet, SG-1 is told there is a chemical leak and gets sedating injections in the infirmary. In fact star-base has been taken over by body-snatching aliens, as Teal'c and Sam discover, who are immune because of his symbiont and her Jolinar-remnants. Teal'c is captured while giving Sam the chance to escape; she meets with Colonel Harry Maybourne, who alas believes and brought the alien-possessed Jack and Daniel, who claim it's paranoia caused by the leaked chemical; during a flight back, Sam is able to see trough the game because of a 'flicker' and discovers it's done by two electronic devices to assume a human shape and voice. Meanwhile the real Jack and Major Paul Davis awake in an organic web where every human is tied into tentacles, soon meeting up with Sam and liberating Teal'c, in a hurry to try Sam's sound-idea before Maybourne sends in troops with orders to shoot and kill</info>

As he could have wiped out the Jaffa by space weapons, he must be looking for something or someone- his consort Ammonet's Harsesis child; Daniel only knew the boy is in Osiris's hiding place from Seth, Kheb, which he nor Teal'c can locate, but Bra'tac knows that is a legendary planet the Goa'uld fear and loathe, and combining with Daniel's Pharaonic mythology knowledge it must be one of the Loc'na ko, exhausted mining planets; he even has an address, the only one the Goa'uld never listed on their space map, but Apophis may be mad enough to brave the ancestral fear. When SG-1 arrives, Bra'tac reads tracks of eight Jaffa, all burned as if by lightning, and a priestess they shot, but who took the Harsesis from her?
