On their first visit to a new planet, SG-1 finds it subject to totally destructive volcanic activity and saves ten natives, the Tollan, a far more technologically advanced society. Their leader Omoc isn't grateful, nor interested in such a primitive race as the earthlings or any of the 'even more primitive' planets which are prepared to host them. Only one Tollan, Narim, shows an active interest in life on earth, especially in captain Samantha Carter and the cat Schrodinger she gives him, explaining his planet was destroyed after the Tolan supplied an unlimited energy source to a primitive neighboring planet which abused it for a cataclysmic weapon. Meanwhile the White House authorized NID colonel Mayborn to take charge over the Tollan for military purposes, exactly Omoc's nightmare.</info>

Assuming that they left without him, he dials up his return home but gets there to find that he is in a different reality. In this world, General Jack O'Neill and Catherine Langford are in charge of the Stargate program; Hammond is a Colonel reporting to O'Neill; and Sam Carter is a civilian scientist working on the project (and also engaged to O'Neill). More importantly, Earth is under attack from the Goa'uld who have already killed over 1 billion people. Carter believes that somehow, Jackson is from a parallel dimension. When Jackson learns the point of origin of the Goa'uld attack, he wants to return to his own universe, believing that his Earth will be similarly attacked.</info>

General Hammond has tried everything to get the senates decision to shut down his space program undone, but the president personally refuses to 'commit political suicide': the Stargate will be buried. Daniel's insistence the danger for earth as a whole outweighs everything convinces his military SG-1 colleagues to ignore the commander general's command and dial the address the goa'ald invasion started from in the parallel dimension he visited. They arrive not on a planet but a new, superior type of starship, already launched by hyper-drive. A 'video' proves it belongs to Apophis, who gives command aboard to his son Klorel, whose host is no other then the team's young Abydos friend Skaara, yet overpowering him seems their best move, while Sam installs explosives in the death glider deck with a 24 hours timer just in case, but Jaffa manage to liberate Klorel and the ship goes far faster then expected...</info>
