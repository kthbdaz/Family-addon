After shooting Harry, Tom disappears once again. Evidence clearly speaks against him.

An investigation into the entire MI5 office takes place while the entire team is under constant watch. To fill the gap that Tom as a senior officer has left, Adam Carter, an MI6 officer, is recruited by Harry to help out MI5.</info>

<info>The Sleeper
The discovery of a nuclear lab in suburban England prompts Harry to activate a long-quiet sleeper agent, a university professor who must sacrifice, albeit temporarily, his name and maybe even his family to trick terrorists into thinking he's created red mercury, a highly efficient chemical detonator. As the op progresses, Tom begins to doubt the wisdom of shaking the sleeper's life to the ground and tries to get the mission scrubbed. </info>
